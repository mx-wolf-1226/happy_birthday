# Happy Birthday

This program checks today's date against the `date` string variable imported from `mybday.py`. 

If the variables match  *(eg. "Nov05")*, then a birthday message will be generated with the lyrics from The Beatles' song, *'Birthday'* 
and post it to the Twitter account linked to the API credentials stored in `creds.py`.

**Please make sure to create both `mybday.py` and `creds.py` *BEFORE* running the program. Failure to do so will cause errors.**


## `mybday.py` Example
```
date = "Nov05"

```


## `creds.py` Example
```
consumer_key = 'API-KEY'
consumer_secret = 'API-SECRET'
access_token = 'API-ACCESS-TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'API-ACCESS-TOKEN-SECRET'

```

### If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Have a great (birth)day! ;-)
